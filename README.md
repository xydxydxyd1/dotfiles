# Eric's dotfiles #
So I can setup my stuff with a couple commands

## Setup ##
- **Put dotfiles (this directory) in home directory**
- make sure there is a `.config` directory in your home directory
- Run [setup.sh](setup.sh) to create symlink at proper places

## Clean up ##
- Run [clean.sh](clean.sh) to reset (before running `setup.sh`)
