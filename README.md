# Eric's dotfiles #

## Setup ##
- Put the whole thing in home directory (due to complications with symlinkign zshrc)
- make sure there is a `.config` directory in your home directory
- Run [link\_files.sh](link_files.sh) to create symlink to zshrc and vimrc
    - note: `.dotfiles` has to be in home directory
- Run `:PlugInstall` in vim to install all the plugins
